Hello everyone!

I moved the Grave Flowers event to a more obvious space since the flowers would kind of hide them. Should make it a bit easier to find now.

The final Bosses \(Gods\) seemed…too easy for Gods. I bumped up Sentinel and Deaths stats per level \(Death is higher than Sentinel’s, which is higher than Creation’s\) and made it go higher, per level. They should be massively harder now.

The Grave Flowers quest wasn’t included in the requirements to have Lost Forest shut off. This has been fixed.

I also noticed that going from Snow Town area into Ice Caves caused the weather not to stop. Snowing, inside a cave? Not anymore.
