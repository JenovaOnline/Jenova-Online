  * Damage formula buffed
    * +5% -&gt; +10% per level
* Meditate, Focus and Convergence Formula change
  * This was due to Mastery Levels boosting the effect sharply and it would be more efficient to nerf the formula then take away this effect
    * Meditate Formula: **a.mat / 3** -&gt; **\(a.mat + a.mdf / 2\) / 6**
    * Focus Formula: **a.mat / 2** -&gt; **\(a.mat + a.mdf / 2\) / 4**
    * Convergence Formula: **a.mat** -&gt; **\(a.mat + a.mdf / 2\) / 2**
      * This still has a good effect due to either Magic Attack or Magic Defense boosting the power
* Attacks now recover 10% of damage dealt as MP
  * This may be nerfed in the future

## Fixed

* Intelligence passive: 16% MAT -&gt; 6% MAT increase
* Main Quest Line Update will appear AFTER you've transferred to the correct location
* Chill, Frost and Freeze skills where causing Paralysis instead of Freeze.
* TP Charge Rate and TP Regen formulas
* Norville Quest line
* Status Icons now show normally on enemies with hue instead of hued itself
* Cape Dread and Fortress City enemies not dropping teleporters
* Harold Dark Path bleed chance on attack
* Guards in front of Lost Forest

## Removed

* Patch Updater and Patch Reset
  * It would be more efficient to start a new game anyway
