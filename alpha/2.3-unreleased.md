Hello everyone!

In this version, certain things that have been a long time coming needed to be addressed, such as caps on damage. I took into account the Attribute caps and gave you a bit more after the caps for Stats. Of course I wont allow enemies to be stronger then your strongest, so they got capped at the same as well.

Jenova Deaths music was supposed to loop at a certain point, but I recently discovered it didn't and when trying to figure out why, I found out it wasn't even taking the configuration at all. So I tried to make it apply and found out it imploded when it was configured to apply. Found out it was because I was using Samples instead of seconds. Took about 3 hours to find the perfect spot for it to loop and fixed it.

Broken Villa needed to be given some love. This is also a precursor to the future update where all EXP/Drop/Gold Rate orbs will be removed from the game. I am not done in this area yet, so be ready for more updates to this area.

Since Darkened/Ultimate weapons are practically the strongest weapons you can have, they might as well be able to boost your Attributes if you have the entire set. The Cloud/Aerith/Jenova/Sephiroth buff is just a nice addition to finding the entire set. More of an achievement then a buff \(although it is still a buff\) if you ask me.

Abbreviations for Gold is a nice QOL update that is was needed. I do know about the gold showing "NaN\(insert abbreviation here\)" in shops and will try to get that fixed \(if not in this version, in the next\).

There was a small oversight on the Norville Quests, but those have been fixed.

Transcendence was not allowing for level cap lifting. The error has been fixed.
